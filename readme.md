# Open exoplanet transit search pipeline

Open exoplanet transit search pipeline (OpenTS) is a Python package for searching exoplanet
transit signals from photometric light curves. OpenTS currently supports K2SC and SPOC TESS 
light curves, but more input sources will be supported soon.

The pipeline is a successor to the "Oxford K2 planet search pipeline" that was used in 
Pope et al. (2016).
